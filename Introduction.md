Diviner is an active information gathering platform, implemented as an extension for the interception proxy OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (<a href='http://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/'>ZAP</a>).<br><br>

The platform can be used to identify abnormal and complex vulnerabilities in web application, through the use of various features designed to "predict" the structure of server side resources.<br><br>

The information obtained through the "divination" process can then be used to isolate suspicious behaviors and identify scenarios and sequences that are required to reproduce them. <br><br>
The following divination process are currently supported:<br>
<ul>
<blockquote><li>Server-Side Source Code Divination</li>
<li>Server-Side Memory Structure Divination</li>
<li>Inter-Process Effect Enumeration</li>
</ul>
